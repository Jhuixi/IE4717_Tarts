                "Umi no Mikaku" (海の味覚) is a Japanese phrase for "Flavors of the Ocean".
                The concept of "Umi no Mikaku" emphasizes the appreciation of the diverse and
                delicate tastes that come from the sea, including fish, shellfish, seaweed,
                and other marine life. It reflects the deep connection between Japanese culture
                and the bountiful resources of the ocean.
